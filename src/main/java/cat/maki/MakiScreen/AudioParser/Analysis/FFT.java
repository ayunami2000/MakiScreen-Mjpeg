/*************************************************************************
 *  Compilation:  javac FFT.java
 *  Execution:    java FFT N
 *  Dependencies: Complex.java
 *
 *  Compute the FFT and inverse FFT of a length N complex sequence.
 *  Bare bones implementation that runs in O(N log N) time. Our goal
 *  is to optimize the clarity of the code, rather than performance.
 *
 *  Limitations
 *  -----------
 *   -  assumes N is a power of 2
 *
 *   -  not the most memory efficient algorithm (because it uses
 *      an object type for representing complex numbers and because
 *      it re-allocates memory for the subarray, instead of doing
 *      in-place or reusing a single temporary array)
 *
